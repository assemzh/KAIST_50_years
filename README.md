The number of courses that have been offered at KAIST has increased gradually over the years. Since it first opened in 1973, KAIST has offered 33,810 regular courses in total. This number is expected to grow further. This interactive visualization shows the distribution of the number of courses in each KAIST department over the past 20 years. 

Users who visit this visualization can choose and compare departments in terms of undergraduate and graduate courses offered. It is also possible to see how different colleges like the College of Natural Sciences or the College of Engineering expanded over time and zoom in and out to control the period you are interested in. 

It's especially fascinating to see how departments like Business and Technology Management (BA), Electrical Engineering (EE), and Computer Science (CS) have rapidly grown in the past 20 years. We also see how new departments like Nanoscience and Technology (NST) or Graduate School of Culture Technology (GCT) have emerged and became fully established over the years. 

Just in 15 years (1999-2013), the total number of regular courses has expanded to 45.5% with Business and Technology Management (BA) having the highest growth rate of 58.8%. The number of departments almost doubled from 16 to 26. 

It clearly shows how KAIST aims toward innovative breakthroughs by diversifying studentsâ€™ choices on their academic background and giving them a chance to master their unique skills on a professional level.
